I am an Assistant Professor in the Deparment of Political Science at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA. My research interests lie in the area of American political behavior, with a focus on Latino politics and the intersection of religion and politics. My work examines how members of particular social groups (such as Latinos and religious individuals) engage in racial, ethnic, religious, and political boundary-making to determine who is an authentic member and representative of their group.

My work has been published in the *American Political Science Review* and *Sociological Focus*.

I received a Ph.D. in political science from Rice University and was previously an assistant professor at Agnes Scott College. Prior to starting my doctoral studies at Rice, I earned a B.Mus. in music performance from Union College (now Union Adventist University).

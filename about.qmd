I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at Rice University and a graduate fellow for the Religion and Public Life Program at the Boniuk Institute for Religious Tolerance.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a bachelor of music degree in clarinet performance from Union College (Lincoln, Nebraska) in 2016. During my time there, I founded and conducted the Recreare Ensemble, a chamber orchestra whose highlights included a performance of Beethoven's First Symphony and a staging of Mozart's musical comedy *Impresario* I also conducted the college's choral, orchestral, and symphonic band ensembles in several performances. In the year between college and attending graduate school, I conducted a string orchestra of homeschoolers and taught clarinet and beginning piano in the Lincoln area.

Outside of academic work, I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, brewing coffee, and playing clarinet whenever I can.

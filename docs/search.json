Forthcoming. “Se Habla Español: Spanish-language Appeals and Candidate Evaluations in the United States.” American Political Science Review. Abstract PDF\n\n  \n    Political candidates use Spanish-language appeals in efforts to increase their support among Hispanic voters. We argue that candidates, Hispanic or not, can use Spanish to signal closeness to Hispanics and posit that the effectiveness of these appeals is conditional on proficiency. To test this, we run two experiments where participants listen to an audio clip of a hypothetical candidate’s stump speech. We vary the ethnicity of the candidate (Anglo or Hispanic) and the language of the speech (English, non-native Spanish, and native-like Spanish). We find that Hispanic support for the Anglo and Hispanic candidates is higher in the native-like Spanish condition compared with the English-only condition. Relative to the English condition, non-native Spanish does not increase support for the Anglo candidate, but it decreases support for the Hispanic candidate. We find mixed effects for Anglo participants. Our results suggest that candidates can effectively appeal to Hispanic voters using Spanish-language messages.\n  \n  \n\nOlson, Shayla and Enrique Quezada-Llanes. “How Sermons Became More Political in the Trump Era.” Book Chapter.

    "text": "Beginning in July 2023, I will be an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Agnes Scott College. My research interests lie in the area of American political behavior, with a focus on Latino representation and the intersection of religion and politics. My work examines how members of particular social groups (such as Latinos and religious individuals) determine who is an authentic representative of their group.\nMy work implicates group-specific language as a key signal of in-group membership and shows how group members respond to political candidates who try to use such language to signal that they are an authentic representative of the group. In a recent article forthcoming at the American Political Science Review, I (with co-authors) show that Latino voters use variation in the accent of candidates’ Spanish-language appeals to judge which candidates are willing and able to be authentic representatives of their group. In my dissertation, I extend this approach to various kinds of religious groups—first identifying the language recognized by different religious groups, and then exploring whether religious voters judge candidates based on the correct use of such language.\n\nI was previously a graduate fellow for the Religion and Public Life Program at the Boniuk Institute for Religious Tolerance and for the Center for the United States and Mexico at the Baker Institute for Public Policy. In the latter position, I hosted and produced the Judy Ley Allen Mexico Centered podcast, where I interviewed many academics as well as current and former government officials from the United States and Mexico.\nI received a Ph.D. in political science from Rice University. Prior to starting my doctoral studies at Rice, I earned a B.Mus. in music performance from Union College (Lincoln, Nebraska)."

During my time there, I founded and conducted the Recreare Ensemble, a chamber orchestra whose highlights included a performance of Beethoven’s First Symphony and a staging of Mozart’s musical comedy Impresario I also conducted the college’s choral, orchestral, and symphonic band ensembles in several performances. In the year between college and attending graduate school, I conducted a string orchestra of homeschoolers and taught clarinet and beginning piano in the Lincoln area.\nOutside of academic work, I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, brewing coffee, and playing clarinet whenever I can (which is not often these days)."
